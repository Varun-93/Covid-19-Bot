# Repository for Covid-19 bot using Dialogflow framework.

I had made a basic chatabot based on Dialogflow framework which helps the users to get the following informations:

1) Information on the number of cases based on the state mentioned by the user.
2) Information on the number of cases in the district based on the pincode mentioned by the user.
3) Helps users by sending the basic FAQ document on COVID-19 on their email id.


In order to achieve the above mentioned objectives, I have used the following APIs:
1) api.covid19india.org/data.json
2) https://pincode.saratchandra.in/api/pincode
